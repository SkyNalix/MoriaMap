# MoriaMap

## Features
At the current state the program is able to load the transport network described in map_data.csv (LECT_NET) and the schedule described in schedule.csv.
It is also able to take two stops and display a path the user need to take on the network to get from one stop to the other (PLAN_0)
and to display the different transports passages for a given stop (LECT_TIME).
The transport network is based off Paris transport network so the stops are named after real stations like "Lourmel".
