# MoriaMap

## Features
At the current state the program is able to load the transport network described in map_data.csv (LECT_NET) and the schedule described in schedule.csv.
It is also able to take two stops and display a non-optimized path the user needs to take on the network to get from one stop to the other (PLAN_0),
display the different transports passages for a given stop (LECT_TIME),
show an optimized in time or distance path to take from given starting and destination stop (PLAN_1)
and be able to have a starting or target point anywhere on earth and find an optimized path between them sometimes taking the transport network, or sometimes not.
The transport network is based off Paris transport network so the stops are named after real stations like "Lourmel".

## Instructions

### Running
Extract zip then run MoriaMap.sh script or java -jar MoriaMap.jar

### Using
After the project is started, you will be asked to enter:

    - 1 if you want to display the non-optimized path between two stops (PLAN_0).
      Then you will be asked to enter the names of the starting stop and the target stop.
      Then you will be shown the path you need to take to get from your starting
      stop to the target's.

    - 2 if you want to display the schedule for a given stop (LECT_TIME).
      Then you will be asked to enter the name of the given stop.
      Then you will be shown the list of passages for the given stop.

    - 3 if you want to display the optimized path between two stops (PLAN_1).
      Then you will be asked to enter the names of the starting stop and the target stop.
      You will be asked to choose if you want to optimize in time (1) or distance (2)
      And then you need to specify at what time do you want to take the path, enter the hours and minutes,
      or just press ENTER at any of them to take your current time.
      Then you will be shown the path you need to take to get from your starting
      stop to the target's, with the times of when you're supposed to arrive and leave a line.

    - 4 Choose this option if you want to start or finish at any given latitude or longitude (PLAN_2)
      Instead of stop names you will be asked for the latitude and longitude for your starting point,
      and the same for your target point. If the starting or target stops position match exactly with
      any of the stops in the transport network then that point will be replaced with the stop instead.
      Just like for PLAN_1 you will then have to choose how do you want to optimize your path
      and at what time do you want to take it.
      The path will then be shown to you with how to make from your starting point/stop, to the target point/stop
      and the moments when you will need to walk will be shown with "Walk for <time> from <start> to <end>"

    - 5 if you want to exit the program

Note: Pressing the Enter key without writing anything allow you to stop the program's execution, or press CTRL+C.
